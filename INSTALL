INSTALL - OpenPrinting cups-browsed v2.1.1 - 2025-01-08
-------------------------------------------------------

This file describes how to compile and install OpenPrinting
cups-browsed from source code. For more information on cups-browsed
see the file called "README.md". A complete change log can be found
in "CHANGES.md".

BEFORE YOU BEGIN

    You'll need ANSI-compliant C, plus a make program and POSIX-compliant
    shell (/bin/sh).  The GNU compiler tools and Bash work well and we have tested
    the current CUPS code against several versions of GCC with excellent results.

    The Makefiles used by the project should work with most versions of make.
    We've tested them with GNU make as well as the make programs shipped by
    Compaq, HP, SGI, and Sun.  BSD users should use GNU make (gmake) since BSD
    make does not support "include".

    libcups (of CUPS 2.2.2 or newer), libcupsfilters 2.x, libppd,
    libavahi-common, libavahi-client, libdbus, and glib must be
    installed to be able to compile this package.

COMPILING THE GIT REPOSITORY CODE

    The cups-browsed GIT repository doesn't hold a copy of the pre-built
    configure script.  You'll need to run the GNU autoconf software (2.65 or
    higher) to create it:

        ./autogen.sh


CONFIGURATION

    cups-browsed uses GNU autoconf, so you should find the usual
    "configure" script in the main cups-browsed source directory.  To
    configure cups-browsed for your system, type:

	./configure

    The default installation will put the cups-browsed software in the
    "/etc" and "/usr" directories on your system.

    Use the "--prefix" option to install the cups-browsed software in another
    location:

	./configure --prefix=/some/directory

    To see a complete list of configuration options, use the --help option:

        ./configure --help

    If any of the dependent libraries are not installed in a system default
    location (typically "/usr/include" and "/usr/lib") you'll need to set the
    CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, DSOFLAGS, and LDFLAGS environment variables
    prior to running configure:

	setenv CFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CPPFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv CXXFLAGS "-I/some/directory"
	setenv DSOFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	setenv LDFLAGS "-L/some/directory"
	./configure ...

    or:

	CFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CPPFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	CXXFLAGS="-I/some/directory" \
	DSOFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	LDFLAGS="-L/some/directory" \
	./configure ...

    Once you have configured things, just type:

	make ENTER

    or if you have FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD type:

	gmake ENTER

    to build the software.


INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE

    Once you have built the software you need to install it.  The "install"
    target provides a quick way to install the software on your local system:

	make install ENTER

    or for FreeBSD, NetBSD, or OpenBSD:

	gmake install ENTER

PACKAGING THE SOFTWARE FOR OPERATING SYSTEM DISTRIBUTIONS

    cups-browsed is mainly needed and actually used to auto-create
    local print queues for auto-discovered IPP print services (remote
    CUPS printers, IPP network printers, IPP-over-USB printers,
    Printer Applications) so that they also get listed by print
    dialogs which do not support CUPS' concept of auto-creating
    temporary print queues on-demand for these services.

    So OS distribution maintainers should check the print dialogs
    (GTK, Qt, application-specific) whether they list all printers,
    including above-mentioned IPP services without running
    cups-browsed and without manual creation of local print
    queues. only if printers are missing, cups-browsed is needed. It
    should be built with the `./configure` option
    `--enable-auto-setup-driverless-only` then.

    Otherwise cups-browsed is only needed for more advanced setups,
    like printer clusters.
